# elements of a linked list is called node
# in each node we can have data filled and link of next node
# the last node has no link of any node so its value is null.
# starting point of each linked list is a refereence to the first node called head/front.
#   similarly last node is called tail/end.
# it is dynamic data structutre.
# stored randomly in memory

# some flaws:
# needs extra memory
# no elements can be accessed randomly
